Jquery Salary Calculator

## Description

This is a salary calculator with inputs for employee first and last names, ID number, title, and annual salary. 
The application takes in these values and stores them in a table, where you can add or remove employees at will.

The app also calculates monthly salary costs and displays them below the table. If the monthly costs exceed
$20,000, it will display how much the budget is exceeded.
